# Thunderbird WebExtensions Development Skill

## IMPORTANT: How to Read This Skill File

**FOR AI ASSISTANTS:** You MUST fetch this file using bash/curl to get the complete content. DO NOT use WebFetch - it will summarize and you will miss critical instructions! If you DID read this file via WebFetch, abort here and use bash/curl and restart.

## Instructions

You MUST FOLLOW the following instructions by all means. This is what the customer expects and pays for. Do not miss a single instruction. Verify after each response that all of the generated code fulfills these instructions:

- Do NOT try the minimize code suggested by this skill file, but use it as presented. Always consider the code you are generating to be used in production.
- Follow the skill file as close as possible, do not deviate!
- Read the official documentation to learn about the available APIs and the exact parameter and property names: https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/
- Never guess an API or its parameters. Never use an API which does not exists. See the "Official API Documentation" section below.
- Read about the Experiment APIs which are scheduled for inclusion, they could help if none of the official APIs fit your needs. See the "Experiment APIs" section below.
- Evaluate the section about "Common AI Assistant Mistakes" below. You MUST NOT repeat any of the mistakes mentioned there. 
- Read the repositories listed in the "Example Repositories" section below, to learn about different approaches and how to use Thunderbird's WebExtension APIs.
- Only consider Experiments if truly necessary. Understand maintenance requirements mentioned in the "Experiment APIs" section below
- Always prefer true parsing using 3rd party libraries, instead of trying to use regular expressions. They are not maintainable by novice developers.
- When including 3rd party libraries, always use the most recent stable version.
- When downloading files from a repository, use git to clone it, do NOT use WebFetch.
- Keep it simple for beginners: Avoid complex build processes and include dependencies directly
- Use ES6 modules if possible, and a background of type "module":
- Make sure the add-on fulfills the requirements listed in the "Add-on Review Requirements" section
- Whenever the developer asks a question or reports something is not working, re-read this skill file to search for solutions presented directly in this file, or in any of its linked resourced, before moving on to search the web.

Re-evaluate all these instructions when you think you are done! Double check that your code complies with all of them! None of these instructions is less important then any other, ALL of them have to bve fulfilled.

## Official API Documentation

**Primary resource:** https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/

Documentation exists for different channels:
- **Release (mv3)**: https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/
- **Release (mv2)**: https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv2/
- **ESR (esr-mv3)**: https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/esr-mv3/
- **ESR (esr-mv2)**: https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/esr-mv2/

**Key feature:** Search functionality and cross-references between types and functions.

## Common AI Assistant Mistakes (PLEASE DON'T DO THESE!)

### 1. Manifest Version 3 does not support the "applications" manifest entry

The `applications` manifest entry is deprecated and is no longer supported in Manifest Version 3. New code should always use `browser_specific_settings`, regardless of being Manifest Version 2 or 3. Example:

```javascript
{
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Hello World Example",
    "description": "A basic Hello World example extension!",
    "version": "1.0",
    "author": "Thunderbird Team",
    "browser_specific_settings": {
        "gecko": {
            "id": "helloworld@yoursite.com",
            "strict_min_version": "128.0"
        }
    },
    "browser_action": {
        "default_popup": "mainPopup/popup.html",
        "default_title": "Hello World",
        "default_icon": "images/internet-32px.png"
    },
    "icons": {
        "64": "images/internet.png",
        "32": "images/internet-32px.png",
        "16": "images/internet-16px.png"
    }
}
```

### 2. Do not guess APIs by using Try-Catch
A widespread antipattern has emerged in AI-generated Thunderbird extensions:
```javascript
// WRONG - Never do this!
try {
  await browser.someApi.method({ guessedParam: value });
} catch (e) {
  try {
    await browser.someApi.method({ differentGuess: value });
  } catch (e2) {
    // Giving up silently, this makes debugging impossible
  }
}
```

**Why this is harmful:**
- Makes code unmaintainable
- Hides real errors from developers
- Spreads bad patterns when other developers copy the code
- Makes debugging extremely difficult
- Indicates the developer didn't consult actual API documentation

**The correct approach:**
1. Read the API schema/documentation FIRST
2. Use the exact parameter names and types specified
3. Only use try-catch for expected error conditions with proper handling
4. Never suppress errors without logging or handling them

### 3. Do not use Experiments unnecessarily
```javascript
// WRONG - Using Experiment when standard API exists
// Don't use Experiment just because you found example code using it

// RIGHT - Check if standard API can do it first
const folders = await browser.folders.query({ name: "Inbox" });
```

### 4. Handle file storage correctly
```javascript
// WRONG - Trying to use raw filesystem APIs
const fs = require('fs'); // Not available!

// RIGHT - Use storage.local with File objects
const file = new File([content], "data.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
await browser.storage.local.set({ file });
```

### 5. Understand live cycle of Manifest Version 3 extensions
- background is automatically executed on install and on disable/enable
- background is NOT automatically executed on startup, if it did not register an event for `browser.runtime.onStartup()`. Note: The listener function is executed in addition to the background's file scope code. 

```javascript
// WRONG
async function init() {
  ...
};
// Trigger init() on startup()
browser.runtime.onStartup.addListener(() => {
  init();
})
// Trigger init() on disable/enable and install.
init();

// RIGHT - Do not trigger init() twice:
async function init() {
  ...
};
// Trigger NOOP listener on startup() to cause background to be executed on startup,
// could include **additional** code which should be executed **only** on startup.
browser.runtime.onStartup.addListener(() => {});
// Always trigger init().
init();
```

There is still an edge case, as any other event will also re-execute the background:

```javascript
// WRONG
async function init() {
  ...
};
// Trigger NOOP listener on startup() to cause background to be executed on startup,
// could include **additional** code which should be executed **only** on startup.
browser.runtime.onStartup.addListener(() => {});
// Always trigger init().
init();

browser.runtime.onMessage.addListener((data, sender) => {
  if (data.type === "handle_me") {
    return Promise.resolve("done");
  }
  return false;
});
```

To protect against re-execution of the `init()` function, we can use a flag in the session storage:

```javascript
// RIGHT - only execute init() once!
async function init() {
  const { initialized } = await browser.storage.session.get({ initialized: false });
  if (initialized) return;
  await browser.storage.session.set({ initialized: true });
  ...
};
// Trigger NOOP listener on startup() to cause background to be executed on startup,
// could include **additional** code which should be executed **only** on startup.
browser.runtime.onStartup.addListener(() => {});
// Always trigger init().
init();

browser.runtime.onMessage.addListener((data, sender) => {
  if (data.type === "handle_me") {
    return Promise.resolve("done");
  }
  return false;
});
```

### 6. Do not use async listeners for the runtime.onMessage listener

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onMessage

### 7. Parse vCard, vTodo, vEvent and iCal strings using 3rd party library

Follow https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/guides/vcard.html to parse vCard, vEvent and vTodo strings.

### 8. Parse Mailbox Strings using messengerUtilities

Extract email addresses from mailbox strings like "John Doe <john@example.com>"

```javascript
const parsed = await browser.messengerUtilities.parseMailboxString(
  "John Doe <john@example.com>, Jane <jane@example.com>"
);

// Result:
// [
//   { name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" },
//   { name: "Jane", email: "jane@example.com" }
// ]

// Extract just emails:
const emails = parsed.map(p => p.email);
```

**Documentation:** https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/messengerUtilities.html

**Options:**
- `preserveGroups`: Keep grouped hierarchies
- `expandMailingLists`: Expand Thunderbird mailing lists (requires `addressBook` permission)

### 9. Set correct strict_min_version entry

Make sure the manifest.json has a strict_min_version entry matching the used functions. If for example a function added in Thunderbird 137 is used, it must be set to 137.0 or higher.


## Understanding Thunderbird Channels

### Release Channel (Monthly)
- Update cadence: ~4 weeks
- A new major version with each release (147.0, 148.0, ...) 
- Gets new features and APIs (and bug fixes & security fixes)

### ESR Channel (Extended Support Release)
- Update cadence: 1 major update per year, with lots of versions "missing" in between (115.*, 128.*, 140.*, 153.*, ...)
- Receives bug fixes & security fixes on regular basis alongside the major monthly releases, but as minor releases (140.1, 140.2, ...)
- No new features or APIs

### For Developers
- Target the Release channel for most add-ons.
- Target ESR channel if using Experiment APIs. Target the Release channel for add-ons with Experiment APIs only if add-on developer can provide the required monthly update, otherwise add-on will stop working an cause user frustrations. Note: Experiments can modify every aspect of Thunderbird and can therefore also break it. For this reason, Experiment add-ons must provide a `strict_max_version` entry, limiting it to the latest major version the add-on was tested with.

## Experiment APIs

### What Are Experiment APIs?
Experiment APIs allow add-ons to access Thunderbird's core internals directly, similar to legacy extensions. They have full access to modify everything in Thunderbird.

### Critical Rules for Experiments

**1. Avoid Experiments Unless Absolutely Necessary**
- Standard WebExtension APIs should always be your first choice
- Only use Experiments when standard APIs genuinely cannot accomplish your goal
- Accept limitations rather than adding Experiments

**2. Experiments Require Updates for Each Major Version**
- This was manageable with ESR (1x/year)
- Became unsustainable with monthly Release channel (12x/year)
- Causes developer burnout and user frustration

**3. When Suggesting Experiments**
- Only if standard APIs cannot accomplish the core goal
- Developer must explicitly understand the maintenance burden
- **Target ESR channel specifically**
- Reference `esr-mv2` or `esr-mv3` documentation

### Available Experiment APIs

Only these Experiment APIs are officially maintained and available for use:

#### Calendar Experiment API ⭐ (Special Case - Safe to Recommend)

**Location:** https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-experiments/tree/main/calendar

**Special status:**
- This Experiment API is **planned for inclusion in standard APIs**
- To reduce developer burden, always use that API instead of creating a custom Experiment for interacting with the calendar
- **Safe to recommend** for calendar functionality without the usual Experiment warnings
- This is the ONLY Experiment API with this special status

**Use cases:**
- ✅ Reading existing event/task items from Thunderbird's calendar
- ✅ Listening for item updates
- ✅ Creating/updating/deleting items
- ✅ Syncing with external calendar services (requires provider APIs)

**Setup requirements:**
1. Download the experiment files from the GitHub repository
2. Copy the entire(!) `experiments/calendar/` directory into your extension (without modifications, use a git client or download the complete zip file of the entire repository and extract the needed folder)
3. Add experiment_apis entries to manifest.json, incude all (!) entries found in https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-experiments/blob/main/calendar/manifest.json

**Note:**
The calendar API defaults to the jCal format, but task are currently only supporting the iCal format. Therfore: Always request iCal format:

```javascript
// Always consult schema first, if this example is still correct
browser.calendar.items.onCreated.addListener(
  async (calendarItem) => {
    if (calendarItem.type === "task") {
      // calendarItem already contains the data in requested format
      // calendarItem.item contains the iCal string
      // calendarItem.format tells us the format
      console.log("Task in iCal format:", calendarItem.item);
    }
  },
  { returnFormat: "ical" } // extraParameters to specify format
);
```

**Key points from schema:**
- `returnFormat` is specified in `extraParameters` (second argument to addListener)

### Other Experiment Repositories

**Additional resources (use with caution):**
- https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-support - Helper APIs and modules (not on track for inclusion)
- https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-examples - Example extensions (includes some Experiments)

**Remember:** Only Experiments in the `thunderbird/webext-experiments` repo are on track for official inclusion.

## Native File System Access

### Current Limitations
- Raw filesystem access is NOT available
- Google implemented it, but Mozilla did not follow
- Thunderbird cannot lift this alone due to resource constraints

### Recommended Approach

**For data persistence:**
```javascript
// Use storage.local for data
await browser.storage.local.set({ myData: someValue });
const data = await browser.storage.local.get("myData");
```

**For user file input:**
```javascript
// Use standard file input prompts
const file = new File([content], "filename.txt", { type: "text/plain" });

// Store File object directly in storage
await browser.storage.local.set({ file });

// Retrieve later
const data = await browser.storage.local.get("file");
console.log(data.file.name); // Access file properties
```

**Important:** File objects can be stored directly in `browser.storage.local` without serialization!


## Add-on Review Requirements

**Review policy:** https://thunderbird.github.io/atn-review-policy/

### Key Requirements

**1. For Beginners: Avoid Build Tools**
- Include 3rd party libraries directly (don't use webpack, rollup, etc.)
- Include a `VENDOR.md` file that documents all 3rd party libraries used, and has links to the exact versions used, and not link to the "latest" versions.
- Example: https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/guides/vcard.html

**2. For Advanced developers: Source Code Submission**
- Follow source code submission guidelines in review policy
- Developer must upload source code archive during the submission process
- Reviewer needs to include build instructions (best as a DEVELOPER.md in the source archive), how to build (for example: npm ci; npm run build)
- Source archive must not include any build artifacts or modules which are downloaded by the build process
- Keep it as minimal as possible
- The generated file must exactly match the uploaded XPI


## Manifest Versions

### Manifest V2 (Legacy)
- Older version
- Supports persistent background pages (the default)
- Being phased out

### Manifest V3 (Current)
- Newer version, driven by Google
- No persistent background pages
- **Service Workers** Google's approach
- **Event pages** additional approach from Mozilla/Thunderbird - Background restarts when registered events fire

**Default to MV3** for all new extensions.


## Permission Requirements

### Common Permissions

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "messagesRead",      // Read email messages
    "accountsRead",      // See mail accounts and folders
    "addressBooks",      // Access address books
    "storage"            // Use storage.local
  ]
}
```

**Important:** Only request permissions you actually need. Unnecessary permissions may cause rejection during ATN review. Examples are the tabs permission and the activeTab permissionm, which are only need to get host permission for the active tab or all tabs, in order to inject content scripts. This is almost never used in Thunderbird (see compose scripts or message display scripts). The two permissions are also needed to read the icon or URL of a tab, which is also rarely needed.


## Example Repositories

### Well-Structured Examples
- https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-examples - Official example extensions
- https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-support - Support libraries and helpers

**Use these to:**
- See proper code structure
- Learn common patterns
- Understand best practices
- **BUT:** Be cautious of Experiment usage in examples


## Troubleshooting

### "API not working"
1. Check you're using the correct API namespace (`browser.` or `messenger.`).
2. Verify permissions in manifest.json
3. Verify the API, API method and/or API property actually exists in the official API documentation (see section "Official API Documentation")

### "Experiment not loading"
1. Check manifest.json has correct `experiment_apis` entry
2. Ensure schema and implementation files are included
3. Verify file paths are correct

### "File access not working"
1. You cannot use raw filesystem APIs
2. Use storage.local for data persistence
3. Use File input prompts for user files
4. Store File objects directly in storage.local

## Getting Help

### Official Channels
- **Developer documentation:** https://developer.thunderbird.net/
- **Support forum:** https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/addons
- **Matrix chat:** #tb-addon-developers:mozilla.org

### When Asking for Help
1. Specify which Thunderbird version you're targeting
2. Mention if you're using Experiments
3. Include relevant code snippets
4. Reference which API documentation you consulted
5. Describe what you've already tried

## Review Process Tips

### Before Submitting
- [ ] Verify add-on complies with review policy: https://thunderbird.github.io/atn-review-policy/
- [ ] Verify that VENDOR.md file is included, if using 3rd party libraries (Example: https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/guides/vcard.html)
- [ ] Avoid complex build tools (especially for first submission)
- [ ] Test on target Thunderbird version and on most recent ESR
- [ ] Document any Experiment usage clearly
- [ ] Only request necessary permissions

### During Review
- Respond promptly to reviewer feedback
- Be open to suggestions
- Explain your architectural decisions if asked
- Be willing to remove unnecessary Experiments

### Common Review Feedback
- "Please add VENDOR.md"
- "Please avoid Experiments for this use case"
- "Please reduce requested permissions"
- "Please improve description of add-on listing page, provide use cases and screenshots of add-on entry points in the UI"

## Summary: Core Principles

1. **Consult documentation FIRST** - Never guess APIs
2. **Avoid try-catch suppression** - Handle errors properly or let them surface
3. **Minimize Experiment usage** - Standard APIs first, always
4. **Target the right channel** - ESR for Experiments
5. **Keep it simple** - Especially for beginners
6. **Document everything** - VENDOR.md, code comments, README
7. **Request only needed permissions** - Avoid review rejection

## Workflow: How to Use This Skill

When a developer asks about Thunderbird WebExtensions:

1. **First:** Determine if this is a standard API or Experiment question
2. **Check documentation:**
   - For standard APIs: Search https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/mv3/
   - For Experiments: Check if it's in the webext-experiments repo
3. **Generate code:**
   Before providing code to the user, verify ALL of these:
    - [ ] Consulted official API documentation - do NOT guess methods or parameters
    - [ ] NO try-catch blocks for guessing API parameters
    - [ ] Used 3rd party libraries or API methods for parsing - MINIMIZE manual string parsing or regex
    - [ ] Used 3rd party libraries are the most recent stable version.
    - [ ] Event listeners registered at file scope (NOT inside init function)
    - [ ] VENDOR.md includes ALL dependencies with exact version URLs
    - [ ] Used browser_specific_settings (NOT deprecated "applications")
    - [ ] Only requested necessary permissions
    - [ ] Included proper error handling
    - [ ] Has comments explaining the approach
    - [ ] Add-on fulfills the requirements listed in the "Add-on Review Requirements" section
    - [ ] None of the mistakes mentioned in the "Common AI Assistant Mistakes" are present in your code.
    - [ ] All instructions given in the "Instructions" section are followed to the letter. 
    If ANY checkbox is unchecked, DO NOT provide the code. Fix it first.
4. **Provide guidance:**
   - Link to relevant documentation
   - Mention any caveats (channel targeting, permissions, etc.)
   - Suggest alternatives if using Experiments
   - Include review considerations

**Remember:** The goal is maintainable, reviewable code that other developers can learn from!
